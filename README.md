🌌 About Me
Hey there! I'm Amrit Roy, a BTech student in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at NIT Srinagar and a BSc Mathematics student at IGNOU. I'm passionate about unraveling the mysteries of the universe through astrophysics, machine learning, and space science. My work spans computational simulations, deep learning models, and interstellar travel concepts, with internships at IISc Bangalore and Empire Space, USA.

🌟 Currently exploring: Dark matter interactions and AI-driven astrophysical data analysis.
🌱 Learning: Advanced gravitational wave analysis and Bayesian inference.
💬 Ask me about: Supernovae, CFD simulations, or neural networks in cosmology!
